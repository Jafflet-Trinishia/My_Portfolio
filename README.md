# Jafflet Trinishia — Portfolio

Single-page portfolio built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It showcases publications, experience, education, and skills with a light/dark theme toggle.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` — start the dev server with HMR.
- `npm run build` — type-check then build for production.
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build.
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint.

## Project Notes
- Styling is hand-written in `src/App.css` and `src/index.css` (no Tailwind).
- Primary content lives in `src/App.tsx`; static assets are in `src/assets/`.
- Built output is not tracked (`dist/` is gitignored).
